description: Full implementation workflow - scout gathers context, planner creates plan, worker implements
---
Use the subagent tool with the chain parameter to execute this workflow:

1. First, use the "scout" agent to find all code relevant to: $@
2. Then, use the "planner" agent to create an implementation plan for "$@" using the context from the previous step (use {previous} placeholder)
3. Finally, use the "worker" agent to implement the plan from the previous step (use {previous} placeholder)

Execute this as a chain, passing output between steps via {previous}. Use fast for straightforward reconnaissance, medium by default for planning and implementation, and complex only for ambiguous or high-consequence steps. Override only the affected step rather than the whole chain.
